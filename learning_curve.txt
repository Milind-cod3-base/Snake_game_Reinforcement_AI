Things learnt during this project:

1. About Enum class and its importance
2. Pygame classes and methods
3. namedtuple: This creates touples which aleady have names, like
        coordinates (x,y) in the project
4. _single_leading_underscore: weak "internal use" indicator.
    E.g. from M import * does not import objects whose name starts 
    with an underscore.

5. why in step 2 of play_step method? there is addition on snake's head?
Ans: the move method which is called above us resets the snake's head coordinates. 
Hence these new coordinates of head must be put inside the snakes body.
Hence, we insert the new head into the snake's head.

6. next_idx = (idx+1)%4, this will move to the next index of the list.
eg. if idx is 0, then (0+1)%4 = 1 and if idx is 1, then (1+1)%4 is 2. Hence the next 
index could be calculated using this.
