Things learnt during this project:

1. About Enum class and its importance
2. Pygame classes and methods
3. namedtuple: This creates touples which aleady have names, like
        coordinates (x,y) in the project
4. _single_leading_underscore: weak "internal use" indicator.
    E.g. from M import * does not import objects whose name starts 
    with an underscore.
